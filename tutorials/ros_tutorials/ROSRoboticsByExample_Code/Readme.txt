Capter 1 has no code, (It explains the advantages of learning ROS. It provides the instructions to install and launch ROS on a computer running a Ubuntu operating system. The Turtlesim simulation is also introduced).

Chapter 4 has no code, (It explores visual sensors and the ability for a robot to map its environment. The knowledge of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping techniques is applied in combination with TurtleBot's navigation stack to move
about in the mapped environment).


Chapter 7 has no code, (It describes a small but growing area of ROS robotics—unmanned air vehicles. Instructions to download and control the simulated quadrotor Hector are supplied. Quadrotor control is via teleoperation or ROS topic/message commands).


Chapter 10 has no code, (It provides a few last ROS capabilities to stimulate the further learning of advanced ROS robotic applications and also provides ability to control a robot with voice commands, the ability for a robot to detect and recognize faces as well as the ability for a robot to speak).
