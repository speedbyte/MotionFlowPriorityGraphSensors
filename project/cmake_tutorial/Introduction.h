/**
    history Cmake: Open source build manager for software projects that  allows developers to specify build
    parameters in a simple portable text  file format. This file is then used by Cmake to generate project files  for
    native build tools suc as Unix etc. If there are source code  generators in your project such as swig wrappers or
    qt generator, cmake  is userful here. The tedious manual process oto create options using an  IDE is taken over
    by cmake. Cmake can handle the differences between the  host and the target system when cross compiling.
